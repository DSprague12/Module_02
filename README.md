# Overview

This project is a C++ program designed to demonstrate core features of the C++ language, including object-oriented design, control flow, and data structures. The software implements a grid-based board system inspired by chess mechanics, allowing pieces to move according to defined rules.

One motivation for starting this project was to create a foundation for more advanced future work. Projects such as chess engines or AI-driven game agents are a natural next step, and this program serves as a starting point for exploring those ideas while strengthening both my C++ skills and my résumé.
